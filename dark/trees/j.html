        <br>It is a native to Indian Subcontinent. Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15-20 metres and is an evergreen tree.
        The neem tree is noted for its drought resistance. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions. It can grow in
         regions with an annual rainfall below 400 mm, but in such cases it depends largely on ground water levels.  
         <p>Products made from neem trees have been used in India for over two millennia for their medicinal properties. Neem products are believed by Siddha 
             and Ayurvedic practitioners to be anthelmintic, antifungal, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antiviral, contraceptive, and sedative.
              It is considered a major component in siddha medicine and Ayurvedic and Unani medicine and is particularly prescribed for skin diseases.
               Neem oil is also used for healthy hair, to improve liver function, detoxify the blood, and balance blood sugar levels. Neem leaves have also
                been used to treat skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, etc.</p>
