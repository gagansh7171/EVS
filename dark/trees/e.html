    <font color="white"><br>Scientific name =<b> <i>Polyalthia longifolia</i></b>
        <br>The false ashoka native to India, is a lofty evergreen tree, commonly planted due to its effectiveness in alleviating noise pollution. It exhibits 
        symmetrical pyramidal growth with willowy weeping pendulous branches and long narrow lanceolate leaves with undulate margins. The tree is known to grow 
        over 30 ft in height.
        <p>Polyalthia is derived from a combination of Greek words meaning "many cures" with reference to the medicinal properties of the tree while Longifolia, 
            in Latin, refers to the length of its leaves.</p>
        <p>In spring the tree is covered with delicate star-like pale green flowers. The flowers last for a short period, usually two to three weeks, are not 
            conspicuous due to their color.

                Fruit is borne in clusters of 10-20, initially green but turning purple or black when ripe. These are loved by birds such as the Koel.</p>
