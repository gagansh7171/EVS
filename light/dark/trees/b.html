        <br>It is a small to medium size evergreen tree, reaching 20 m tall. The leaves are strap-shaped, 6 - 12 cm long, and about 1 cm broad, with a central midrib. 
        The cones are borne on a short stem, and have 2-4 scales, usually only one (sometimes two) fertile, each fertile scale bearing a single apical seed 10 - 15 mm.
         When mature, the scales swell up and become reddish purple, fleshy and berry-like, 10 - 20 mm long; they are then eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds 
         in their droppings. 

        Podocarpus macrophyllus occurs in forests, open thickets, and roadsides from near sea level to 1000 m.<br>They have also found their use in decorative purposes.
