        <br><p>The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a "corm".
         Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for "trees", but what appears to be a trunk is actually a "false stem" or pseudostem. 
        Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.
        <p>The banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called "hands"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The
             hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3-20 tiers, or commercially as a "banana stem", and can weigh 30-50 kilograms. Individual
              banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or "finger") average 125 grams, of which approximately 75% is water and 25% dry matter
