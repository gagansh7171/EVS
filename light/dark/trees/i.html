    <font color="white"><br>Scientific name =<b> <i>Roystonea regia</i></b>
        <br>It is a large palm which reaches a height of 20-30 metres. The trunk is stout, very smooth and grey-white in colour with a characteristic bulge 
        below a distinctive green crownshaft.Root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria have been found on R. regia trees in India. The presence of rhizobia-
        containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; this was the first record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree.
        In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone.
        <p>It has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental.The seed is used as a source of oil and for livestock feed.
             Leaves are used for thatching and the wood for construction.The roots are used as a treatment for diabetes.</p>
