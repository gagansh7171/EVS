    <font color="white"><br>Scientific name =<b> <i>Hamelia patens</i></b>
        <br><p>Firebush has orangish - red tubular flowers, which recruit hummingbirds and butterflies for pollination.
         The corollas vary greatly in length, making them attractive to a wide range of pollinators.
          The fruit is a small dark red berry, turning black at maturity.

        Despite its somewhat scraggy appearance, this is a valuable garden tree in warmer climates and even in temperate ones, as long as the soil remains above freezing.
    </p><p>Hummingbirds are attracted by its flowers and other birds feed on the fruit, both of which will also 
            forage on small insects found in the vicinity, helping to keep down pests. These flowers are also fed on by butterflies.
            The fruits have a refreshing, acidic taste and are also edible by humans; in Mexico, they are made into a fermented drink.</p>
            <p> The plant has got some medicinal value as well.</p>
