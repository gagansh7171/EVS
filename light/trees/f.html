        <br>Paulownia elongata is a species of tree in the family Paulowniaceae, native to Asia.

        The plant's leaves are very large and pubescent ("fuzzy-hairy"). This species 
        can withstand a very wide range of environmental conditions. It does not grow at higher altitudes however.
        <p>It  is cultivated as an ornamental tree for use in gardens and parks. It is selected for its purple flowers, and its shade tolerance.
                The tree is planted and grown as feedstock for biofuel production. Due to the large quantity of biomass produced annually, it is
                 suited for use as biofuel feedstock. It is reportedly the fastest-growing hardwood tree.
        </p>
        It can be distinguished from Catalpa , a plant whose leaves closely resembles Paulownia's by looking at leaf pattern. Catalpa's leaves grow in a pair 
        of 3 while Paulownia has 2 leaves growing in opposite sides.
